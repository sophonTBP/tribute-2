          The human brain has some capabilities that the brains of other animals lack. It is to these distinctive
          capabilities that our species owes its dominant position. Other animals have stronger muscles or sharper
          claws, but we have cleverer brains.

          If machine brains one day come to surpass human brains in general intelligence, then this new
          superintelligence could become very powerful. As the fate of the gorillas now depends more on us humans than
          on the gorillas themselves, so the fate of our species then would come to depend on the actions of the machine
          superintelligence.

          But we have one advantage: we get to make the first move. Will it be possible to construct a seed AI or
          otherwise to engineer initial conditions so as to make an intelligence explosion survivable? How could one
          achieve a controlled detonation?
          To get closer to an answer to this question, we must make our way through a fascinating landscape of topics
          and considerations. Read the book and learn about oracles, genies, singletons; about boxing methods,
          tripwires, and mind crime; about humanity's cosmic endowment and differential technological development;
          indirect normativity, instrumental convergence, whole brain emulation and technology couplings; Malthusian
          economics and dystopian evolution; artificial intelligence, and biological
          cognitive enhancement, and collective intelligence.

          This profoundly ambitious and original book picks its way carefully through a vast tract of forbiddingly
          difficult intellectual terrain. Yet the writing is so lucid that it somehow makes it all seem easy. After an
          utterly engrossing journey that takes us to the frontiers of thinking about the human condition and the future
          of intelligent life, we find in Nick Bostrom's work nothing less than a reconceptualization of the essential
          task of our time.</p>

          A global catastrophic risk is one with the potential to wreak death and destruction on a global scale. In
          human history, wars and plagues have done so on more than one occasion, and misguided ideologies and
          totalitarian regimes have darkened an entire era or a region. Advances in technology are adding dangers of a
          new kind. It could happen again.

          In Global Catastrophic Risks 25 leading experts look at the gravest risks facing humanity in the 21st century,
          including asteroid impacts, gamma-ray bursts, Earth-based natural catastrophes, nuclear war, terrorism, global
          warming, biological weapons, totalitarianism, advanced nanotechnology, general artificial intelligence, and
          social collapse. The book also addresses over-arching issues - policy responses and methods for predicting and
          managing catastrophes.

          This is invaluable reading for anyone interested in the big issues of our time; for students focusing on
          science, society, technology, and public policy; and for academics, policy-makers, and professionals working
          in these acutely important fields.

          Anthropic Bias explores how to reason when you suspect that your evidence is biased by "observation selection
          effects"--that is, evidence that has been filtered by the precondition that there be some suitably positioned
          observer to "have" the evidence. This conundrum--sometimes alluded to as "the anthropic principle,"
          "self-locating belief," or "indexical information"--turns out to be a surprisingly perplexing and
          intellectually stimulating challenge, one abounding with important implications for many areas in science and
          philosophy.

          There are the philosophical thought experiments and paradoxes: the Doomsday Argument; Sleeping Beauty; the
          Presumptuous Philosopher; Adam & Eve; the Absent-Minded Driver; the Shooting Room.

          And there are the applications in contemporary science: cosmology ("How many universes are there?", "Why does
          the universe appear fine-tuned for life?"); evolutionary theory ("How improbable was the evolution of
          intelligent life on our planet?"); the problem of time's arrow ("Can it be given a thermodynamic
          explanation?"); quantum physics ("How can the many-worlds theory be tested?"); game-theory problems with
          imperfect recall ("How to model them?"); even traffic analysis ("Why is the 'next lane' faster?").

          Anthropic Bias argues that the same principles are at work across all these domains. And it offers a
          synthesis: a mathematically explicit theory of observation selection effects that attempts to meet scientific
          needs while steering clear of philosophical paradox.

          To what extent should we use technology to try to make better human beings? Because of the remarkable advances
          in biomedical science, we must now find an answer to this question.

          Human enhancement aims to increase human capacities above normal levels. Many forms of human enhancement are
          already in use. Many students and academics take cognition enhancing drugs to get a competitive edge. Some top
          athletes boost their performance with legal and illegal substances. Many an office worker begins each day with
          a dose of caffeine. This is only the beginning. As science and technology advance further, it will become
          increasingly possible to enhance basic human capacities to increase or modulate cognition, mood, personality,
          and physical performance, and to control the biological processes underlying normal aging. Some have suggested
          that such advances would take us beyond the bounds of human nature.

          These trends, and these dramatic prospects, raise profound ethical questions. They have generated intense
          public debate and have become a central topic of discussion within practical ethics. Should we side with
          bioconservatives, and forgo the use of any biomedical interventions aimed at enhancing human capacities?
          Should we side with transhumanists and embrace the new opportunities? Or should we perhaps plot some middle
          course?

          Human Enhancement presents the latest moves in this crucial debate: original contributions from many of the
          world's leading ethicists and moral thinkers, representing a wide range of perspectives, advocates and
          sceptics, enthusiasts and moderates. These are the arguments that will determine how humanity develops in the
          near future.

        <h2>WHERE ARE THEY? WHY I HOPE THE SEARCH FOR EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE FINDS NOTHING</h2>

        <p>Nick Bostrom Future of Humanity Institute Oxford University</p>

        <p>When water was discovered on Mars, people got very excited. Where there is water,
          there may be life. Scientists are planning new missions to study the planet up close.
          NASA’s next Mars rover is scheduled to arrive in 2010. In the decade following, a Mars
          Sample Return mission might be launched, which would use robotic systems to collect
          samples of Martian rocks, soils, and atmosphere, and return them to Earth. We could
          then analyze the sample to see if it contains any traces of life, whether extinct or still
          active. Such a discovery would be of tremendous scientific significance. What could be
          more fascinating than discovering life that had evolved entirely independently of life
          here on Earth? Many people would also find it heartening to learn that we are not
          entirely alone in this vast cold cosmos.</p>
        <p>But I hope that our Mars probes will discover nothing. It would be good news if we find
          Mars to be completely sterile. Dead rocks and lifeless sands would lift my spirit.</p>
        <p>Conversely, if we discovered traces of some simple extinct life form—some bacteria,
          some algae—it would be bad news. If we found fossils of something more advanced,
          perhaps something looking like the remnants of a trilobite or even the skeleton of a
          small mammal, it would be very bad news. The more complex the life we found, the
          more depressing the news of its existence would be. Scientifically interesting, certainly,
          but a bad omen for the future of the human race</p>
        <p>How do I arrive at this conclusion? I begin by reflecting on a well‐known fact. UFO‐
          spotters, Raelian cultists, and self‐certified alien abductees notwithstanding, humans
          have, to date, seen no sign of any extraterrestrial intelligent civilization. We have not
          received any visitors from space, nor have our radio telescopes detected any signals
          transmitted by any extraterrestrial civilization. The Search for Extra‐Terrestrial
          Intelligent Life (SETI) has been going for nearly fifty years, employing increasingly
          powerful telescopes and data mining techniques, and has so far consistently corroborated the null hypothesis.
          As best we have been able to determine, the night sky
          is empty and silent—the question “Where are they?” thus being at least as pertinent
          today as it was when Enrico Fermi first posed it during a lunch discussion with some of
          his physicist colleagues back in 1950.</p>
        <p>Here is another fact: There are on the order of 100 billion stars in our galaxy alone, and
          the observable universe contains on the order of 100 billion galaxies. In the last couple of
          decades, we have learnt that many of these stars have planets circling around them. By
          now, several hundred exoplanets we have discovered. Most of these are gigantic, but
          this is due to a selection effect: It is very difficult to detect smaller exoplanets with
          current observation methods. (In most cases, the planets cannot be directly observed.
          Their existence is inferred from their gravitational influence on their parent sun, which
          wobbles slightly when pulled towards a large orbiting planet; or alternatively by a slight
          fluctuation in their sun’s perceived luminosity which occurs when it is partially eclipsed
          by the exoplanet.) We have every reason to believe that the observable universe contains
          vast numbers of solar systems, including many that have planets that are Earth‐like at
          least in the sense of having a mass and temperature similar to those of our own orb. We
          also know that many of these solar systems are much older than ours.
        </p>

        <p>From these two facts it follows that there exists a “Great Filter”.
          1
          The Great Filter can be
          thought of as a probability barrier. It consists of one or more highly improbable
          evolutionary transitions or steps whose occurrence is required in order for an Earth‐like
          planet to produce an intelligent civilization of a type that would be visible to us with our
          current observation technology. You start with billions and billions of potential
          germination points for life, and you end up with a sum total of zero extraterrestrial
          civilizations that we can observe. The Great Filter must therefore be powerful enough—
          which is to say, the critical steps must be improbable enough—that even with many
          billions rolls of the dice, one ends up with nothing: no aliens, no spacecraft, no signals, at
          least none that we can detect in our neck of the woods.</p>
        <p>Now, an important question for us is, just where might this Great Filter be located?
          There are two basic possibilities: It might be behind us, somewhere in our distant past.
          Or it might be ahead of us, somewhere in the millennia or decades to come. Let us
          ponder these possibilities in turn.</p>
        <p>Consider first the possibility that the filter is in our past. This would mean that there is
          some extremely improbable step in the sequence of events whereby an Earth‐like planet
          gives rise to an intelligent life form comparable in its technological sophistication to our contemporary
          human civilization. Some people seem to take it for granted that evolution
          of intelligent life on this planet was straightforward—lengthy, yes, complex, sure, yet
          ultimately inevitable or nearly so. Carl Sagan appears to have held this view; he once
          wrote that “the origin of life must be a highly probable circumstance; as soon as
          conditions permit, up it pops!”
          2
          But this view might well be completely mistaken. There
          is at any rate hardly any evidence to support it. Evolutionary biology, at the moment,
          does not enable us to calculate from first principles how probable or improbable the
          evolution of intelligent life on Earth was. Moreover, if we look back at the history of life
          on this planet, we can identify a number of evolutionary transitions each one of which is
          a plausible candidate Great Filter.</p>
        <p>For example, perhaps it is very, very improbable that even simple self‐replicators should
          emerge on any given Earth‐like planet. Attempts to create life in the laboratory by
          mixing water and gases believed to have existed in the early atmosphere on Earth have
          failed to get much beyond the synthesis of a few simple amino acids. No instance of
          abiogenesis has ever been observed.</p>
        <p>The oldest confirmed microfossils date from approximately 3,500 million years ago, and
          there is tentative evidence that life might have existed a few hundred million years prior
          to that date, but no evidence of life before 3,800 million years ago. Life might well have
          arisen considerably earlier than that without leaving any traces. There are very few
          preserved rock formations this old and such as have survived have undergone major
          remolding over the eons. Nevertheless, there is a period lasting several hundreds of
          millions of years between the formation of Earth and the first known life. The evidence
          is thus consistent with the hypothesis that the emergence of life required an extremely
          improbable set of coincidences, and that it took hundreds of millions of years of trial‐
          and‐error, of molecules and surface structures randomly interacting, before something
          capable of self‐replication happened to appear by a stroke of astronomical luck. For
          aught we know, this first critical step could be a Great Filter.</p>
        <p>Since we cannot rerun the history of life multiple times to obtain rigorous statistics, it is
          difficult to determine conclusively the “difficulty” of any given evolutionary
          development. There are, however, some criteria that we can use to identify evolutionary
          transitions that are at least good candidates for being a Great Filter, i.e. that are both
          extremely improbable and practically necessary for the eventual emergence of intelligent
          technological civilization. One criterion is that the transition should have occurred only
          once. Flight, sight, photosynthesis, and limbs have all evolved several times here on
          Earth, and are thus ruled out. Another indication that an evolutionary step was very
          improbable is that it took a very long time for it to occur even after its prerequisites were in place. A long
          delay suggests that a vastly many random recombinations had to be
          tried before one was found that worked. Perhaps several improbable mutations had to
          occur all at once in order to leap from one local fitness peak to another: the mutations
          might individually be deleterious and only fitness‐enhancing when they occur together.
          (The evolution of Homo sapiens from one of our recent hominid ancestors, such as Homo
          erectus, happened rather quickly on geological timescales, so this step would be a
          relatively weak candidate for a Great Filter.)</p>
        <p>The original emergence of life appears to meet these two criteria. As far as we know, it
          might have occurred only once and it might have taken hundreds of millions of years for
          it to happen even after the planet had cooled down sufficiently to enable a wide range of
          organic molecules to be stable. Later evolutionary history offers additional candidates
          for the Great Filter. For example, it took some 1.8 billion years for prokaryotes (the most
          basic type of single‐cell organism) to evolve into eukaryotes (a more complex kind of cell
          with a membrane‐enclosed nucleus). 1.8 billion years is a long time, and as far as we
          know eukaryotes evolved only once, making this transition an excellent possible Great
          Filter. Other strong candidates include the rise of multi‐cellular organisms and sexual
          reproduction.</p>
        <p>So one possibility is that the Great Filter is behind us. This would explain the absence of
          observable aliens. Why? Because if the rise of intelligent life on any one planet is
          sufficiently improbable, then it follows that we are most likely the only such civilization
          in our galaxy or even in the entire observable universe. (The observable universe
          contains approximately 1022 stars. The universe might well extend infinitely far beyond
          the part that is observable by us, and may contain infinitely many stars. If so, then it is
          virtually certain that there exists an infinite number of intelligent extraterrestrial species,
          no matter how improbable their evolution on any given planet. However, cosmological
          theory implies that, due to the expansion of the universe, any life outside the observable
          universe is and will forever remain causally disconnected from us: it can never visit us,
          communicate with us, or be seen by us or our descendants.)</p>
        <p>The other possibility is that the Great Filter is after us, in our future. This would mean
          that there is some great improbability that prevents almost all technological civilizations
          at our current human stage of development from progressing to the point where they
          engage in large‐scale space‐colonization and make their presence known to other
          technological civilizations. For example, it might be that any sufficiently technologically
          advanced civilization discovers some technology—perhaps some very powerful
          weapons technology—that causes its extinction.</p>
        <p>I will return to this scenario shortly, but first I shall say a few words about another
          theoretical possibility: that the extraterrestrials are out there, in abundance but hidden
          from our view. I think this is unlikely, because if extraterrestrials do exist in any numbers, it’s reasonable
          to think at least one species would have already expanded
          throughout the galaxy, or beyond. Yet we have met no one.</p>
        <p>Various schemes have been proposed for how an intelligent species might colonize
          space. They might send out “manned” space ships, which would establish colonies and
          “terraform” new planets, beginning with worlds in their own solar system before
          moving on to more distant destinations. But much more likely, in my view, would be
          colonization by means of so‐called “von Neumann probes”, named after the Hungarian‐
          born prodigy John von Neumann, who included among his many mathematical and
          scientific achievements the development of the concept of a universal constructor. A von
          Neumann probe would be an unmanned self‐replicating spacecraft, controlled by
          artificial intelligence, capable of interstellar travel. A probe would land on a planet (or a
          moon or asteroid), where it would mine raw materials to create multiple replicas of itself,
          perhaps using advanced forms of nanotechnology. These replicas would then be
          launched in various directions, thus setting in motion a multiplying colonization wave. 3
          Our galaxy is about 100,000 light years across. If a probe were capable of travelling at
          one‐tenth of the speed of light, every planet in the galaxy could thus be colonized within
          a couple of million years (allowing some time for the bootstrapping process that needs to
          take place between a probe’s landing on a resource site, setting up the necessary
          infrastructure, and producing daughter probes). If travel speed were limited to 1% of
          light speed, colonization might take twenty million years instead. The exact numbers do
          not matter much because they are at any rate very short compared to the astronomical
          time scales involved in the evolution of intelligent life from scratch (billions of years).</p>

        <p>If building a von Neumann probe seems like a very difficult thing to do—well, surely it
          is, but we are not talking about a proposal for something that NASA or the European
          Space Agency should get to work on today. Rather, we are considering what would be
          accomplish with some future very advanced technology. We ourselves might build
          Neumann probes in decades, centuries, or millennia—intervals that are mere blips
          compared to the lifespan of a planet. Considering that space travel was science fiction a
          mere half century ago, we should, I think, be extremely reluctant to proclaim something
          forever technologically infeasible unless it conflicts with some hard physical constraint.
          Our early space probes are already out there: Voyager 1, for example, is now beyond our
          solar system</p>
        <p>Even if an advanced technological civilization could spread throughout the galaxy in a
          relatively short period of time (and thereafter spread to neighboring galaxies), one might
          still wonder whether it would opt to do so. Perhaps it would rather choose to stay at
          home and live in harmony with nature. However, there are a number of considerations
          that make this a less plausible explanation of the great silence. First, we observe that life here on Earth
          manifests a very strong tendency to spread wherever it can. On our planet,
          life has spread to every nook and cranny that can sustain it: East, West, North, and
          South; land, water, and air; desert, tropic, and arctic ice; underground rocks,
          hydrothermal vents, and radioactive waste dumps; there are even living beings inside
          the bodies of other living beings. This empirical finding is of course entirely consonant
          with what one would expect on the basis of elementary evolutionary theory. Second, if
          we consider our own species in particular, we also find that it has spread to every part of
          the planet, and we even have even established a presence in space, at vast expense, with
          the international space station. Third, there is an obvious reason for an advanced
          civilization that has the technology to go into space relatively cheaply to do so: namely,
          that’s where most of the resources are. Land, minerals, energy, negentropy, matter: all
          abundant out there yet limited on any one home planet. These resources could be used
          to support a growing population and to construct giant temples or supercomputers or
          whatever structures a civilization values. Fourth, even if some advanced civilization
          were non‐expansionary to begin with, it might change its mind after a hundred years or
          fifty thousand years—a delay too short to matter. Fifth, even if some advanced
          civilization chose to remain non‐expansionist forever, it would still not make any
          difference if there were at least one other civilization out there that at some point opted
          to launch a colonization process: that expansionary civilization would then be the one
          whose probes, colonies, or descendants would fill the galaxy. It takes but one match to
          start a fire; only one expansionist civilization to launch the colonization of the universe.</p>
        <p>For all these reasons it seems unlikely that the galaxy is teeming with intelligent life and
          that the reason we haven’t seen any of them is that they all confine themselves to their
          home planets. Now, it is possible to concoct scenarios in which the universe is swarming
          with advanced civilizations every one of which chooses to keep itself well hidden from
          our view. Maybe there is a secret society of advanced civilizations that know about us
          but have decided not to contact us until we’re mature enough to be admitted into their
          club. Perhaps they’re observing us, like animals in a zoo. I don’t see how we can
          conclusively rule out this possibility. But I will set it aside for the remainder of this essay
          in order to concentrate what to me appears to be more plausible answers to Fermi’s
          question.</p>
        <p>A disconcerting hypothesis is that the Great Filter consists in some destructive tendency
          common to virtually all sufficiently advanced technological civilizations. Throughout
          history, great civilizations on Earth have imploded—the Roman Empire, the Mayan
          civilization that once flourished in Central America, and many others. However, the
          kind of societal collapse that merely delays the eventual emergence of a space‐colonizing
          civilization by a few hundred or a few thousand years would not help explain why no
          such civilization has visited us from another planet. A thousand years may seem a long
          time to an individual, but in this context it’s a sneeze. There are planets that are billions
          of years older than Earth. Any intelligent species on those planets would have had ample time to recover from
          repeated social or ecological collapses. Even if they failed a
          thousand times before they succeeded, they could still have arrived here hundreds of
          millions of years ago.</p>
        <p>To constitute an effective Great Filter, we hypothesize a terminal global cataclysm: an
          existential catastrophe. An existential risk is one where an adverse outcome would
          annihilate Earth‐originating intelligent life or permanently and drastically curtail its
          potential for future development. We can identify a number of potential existential
          risks: nuclear war fought with stockpiles much greater than those that exist today
          (maybe resulting from future arms races); a genetically engineered superbug;
          environmental disaster; asteroid impact; wars or terrorists act committed with powerful
          future weapons, perhaps based on advanced forms of nanotechnology; superintelligent
          general artificial intelligence with destructive goals; high‐energy physics experiments; a
          permanent global Brave‐New‐World‐like totalitarian regime protected from revolution
          by new surveillance and mind control technologies. These are just some of the existential
          risks that have been discussed in the literature, and considering that many of these have
          been conceptualized only in recent decades, it is plausible to assume that there are
          further existential risks that we have not yet thought of.</p>
        <p>The study of existential risks is an extremely important albeit rather neglected field of
          inquiry. But here we must limit ourselves to making just one point. In order for some
          existential risk to constitute a plausible Great Filter, it is not sufficient that we judge it to
          have a significant subjective probability of destroying humanity. Rather, it must be of a
          kind that could with some plausibility be postulated to destroy virtually all sufficiently
          advanced civilizations. For instance, stochastic natural disasters such as asteroid hits and
          super‐volcanic eruptions are unlikely Great Filter candidates, because even if they
          destroyed a significant number of civilizations we would expect some civilizations to get
          lucky and escape disaster; and some of these civilizations could then go on to colonize
          the universe. Perhaps the most likely type of existential risks that could constitute a
          Great Filter are those that arise from technological discovery. It is not farfetched to
          suppose that there might be some possible technology which is such that (a) virtually all
          sufficiently advanced civilizations eventually discover it and (b) its discovery leads
          almost universally to existential disaster.</p>
        <p>So where is the Great Filter? Behind us, or not behind us?</p>
        <p>If the Great Filter is ahead of us, we have still to confront it. If it is true that almost all
          intelligent species go extinct before they master the technology for space colonization,
          then we must expect that our own species, too, will go extinct before reaching
          technological maturity, since we have no reason to think that we will be any luckier than
          most other species at our stage of development. If the Great Filter is ahead of us, we
          must relinquish all hope of ever colonizing the galaxy; and we must fear that our
          adventure will end soon, or at any rate, prematurely. Therefore, we better hope that the
          Great Filter is behind us.</p>
        <p>What has all this got to do with finding life on Mars? Consider the implications of
          discovering that life had evolved independently on Mars (or some other planet in our
          solar system). That discovery would suggest that the emergence of life is not a very
          improbable event. If it happened independently twice here in our own back yard, it
          must surely have happened millions times across the galaxy. This would mean that the
          Great Filter is less likely to occur in the early life of planets and is therefore more likely
          still to come.</p>
        <p>If we discovered some very simple life forms on Mars in its soil or under the ice at the
          polar caps, it would show that the Great Filter must exist somewhere after that period in
          evolution. This would be disturbing, but we might still hope that the Great Filter was
          located in our past. If we discovered a more advanced life‐form, such as some kind of
          multi‐cellular organism, that would eliminate a much larger stretch of potential locations
          where the Great Filter could be. The effect would be to shift the probability more
          strongly to the hypothesis that the Great Filter is ahead of us, not behind us. And if we
          discovered the fossils of some very complex life form, such as of some vertebrate‐like
          creature, we would have to conclude that the probability is very great that the bulk of the
          Great Filter is ahead of us. Such a discovery would be a crushing blow. It would be by
          far the worst news ever printed on a newspaper cover.</p>
        <p>Yet most people reading the about the discovery would be thrilled. They would not
          understand the implications. If the Great Filter is not behind us, it is ahead of us.</p>
        <p>So this is why I’m hoping that our space probes will discover dead rocks and lifeless
          sands on Mars, on Jupiter’s moon Europa, and everywhere else our astronomers look. It
          would keep alive the hope for a great future for humanity.</p>
        <p>Now, it might be thought an amazing coincidence if Earth were the only planet in the
          galaxy on which intelligent life evolved. If it happened here—the one planet we have
          studied closely—surely one would expect it to have happened on a lot of other planets in
          the galaxy also, which we have not yet had the chance to examine? This objection,
          however, rests on a fallacy: It overlooks what is known as an “observation selection
          effect.” Whether intelligent life is common or rare, every observer is guaranteed to find
          themselves originating from a place where intelligent life did, indeed, arise. Since only
          the successes give rise to observers who can wonder about their existence, it would be a
          mistake to regard our planet as a randomly‐selected sample from all planets. (It would
          be closer to the mark to regard our planet as though it were a random sample from the
          subset of planets that did engender intelligent life: this being a crude formulation of one
          of the sane elements extractable from the motley ore of ideas referred to as the “anthropic
          principle”.)</p>
        <p>Since this point confuses many, it is worth expounding it slightly. Consider two different
          hypotheses. One says that the evolution of intelligent life is fairly easy and happens on a
          significant fraction of all suitable planets. The other hypothesis says that the evolution of
          intelligent life is extremely difficult and happens perhaps only on one out of a million
          billions planets. To evaluate their plausibility in light of your evidence, you must ask
          yourself, “What do these hypotheses predict that I should observe?” If you think about
          it, it is clear that both hypotheses predict that you should observe that your civilization
          originated in places where intelligent life evolved. All observers will observe precisely
          that, whether the evolution of intelligent life happened on a large or a small fraction of all
          planets. An observation selection effect guarantees that whatever planet we call “ours”
          was a success story. And as long as the total number of planets in the universe is large
          enough to compensate for the low probability of any given one of them giving rise to
          intelligent life, it is not a surprise that a few success stories exist.</p>
        <p>If—as I hope is the case—we are the only intelligent species that has ever evolved in our
          galaxy, and perhaps in the entire observable universe, it does not follow that our survival
          is not in danger. Nothing in the above reasoning precludes the Great Filter from being
          located both behind us and ahead of us. It might both be extremely improbable that
          intelligent life should arise on any given planet, and very improbable that intelligent life,
          once evolved, should succeed in becoming advanced enough to colonize space.</p>
        <p>But we would have some grounds for hope that all or most of the Great Filter is in our
          past if Mars is indeed found to be barren. In that case, we may have a significant chance
          of one day growing into something almost unimaginably greater than we are today</p>
        <p>In this scenario, the entire history of humankind to date is a mere instant compared to
          the eons of history that lie still before us. All the triumphs and tribulations of the
          millions of peoples the have walked the Earth since the ancient civilization of
          Mesopotamia would be like mere birth pangs in the delivery of a kind of life that hasn’t
          really begun yet. For surely it would be the height of naiveté to think that with the
          transformative technologies already in sight—genetics, nanotechnology and so on—and
          with thousands of millennia still ahead of us to perfect and apply these technologies and
          others that we haven’t yet conceived of, human nature and the human condition will
          remain unchanged for all future. Instead, if we survive and prosper, we will presumably
          develop into some kind of posthuman existence.</p>
        <p>So this is why I conclude that the silence of the night sky is golden, and why, in the
          search for extraterrestrial life, no news is good news. It promises a potentially great
          future for humanity</p>
        <p>None of this means that we ought to cancel our plans to have a closer look at Mars. If the
          red planet ever harbored life, we might as well find out about it. It might be bad news,
          but it would tell us something about our place in the universe, our future technological
          prospects, the existential risks confronting us, the possibilities for human transformation:
          issues of considerable importance.</p>
        <p>It is impossible to know in advance what insights might be gleaned by applying the kind
          of careful and systematic study to such big questions that we apply every day to smaller
          and less consequential technological and scientific problems. There may be surprising
          arguments and ideas out there merely waiting to be discovered. Some of these might
          even turn out to have practical ramifications of such importance as to change our whole
          scheme of priorities. Perhaps the greatest benefit from the SETI program will result if it
          prompts thinking about these larger matters.</p>
        <p>Theoretically, smart ambitious scholars could start thinking without waiting for such
          prompts. Expensive instruments, however, have a way of lending scientific status and
          respectability to a field of inquiry. Academics are keen to put as much distance as
          possible between themselves and the kooks and cranks that flock to these big questions.
          If large telescopes, NASA satellites, and complicated mathematical data analysis are
          involved, it becomes harder for outside observers to mistake the work for the ramblings
          of UFO‐nuts and other crackpots. There may be no signals from space, yet those with
          their antennas tuned to more anthropomorphic wavelengths are sure to pick up a buzz of
          social signaling in people’s attitudes towards the search for extraterrestrial beings. Such
          social background noise might in fact be one of the main obstacles to intellectual progress
          on many big picture topics.</p>
